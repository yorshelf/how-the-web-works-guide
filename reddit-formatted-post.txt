-- **Post Title**
If you don't know how browser-server communication works, check this. 
I compiled a list of ressources that helped me better understand how the web works as a web developer.

-- **Post Content**
I'm a computer science student and I develop web applications/websites in my spare time.  
The following links helped me getting a better overview and practical understanding of the web mechanics to develop web applications/websites.
I think others can benefit from them.  
&nbsp;  
I advise you to work through them in the numbered order as that's how I discovered them, especially if you're new to this subject.  
All feedback is welcome. I plan to improve this guide and pass it to friends.  
&nbsp;  


Networking experts, feel free to criticize it. I'll edit it if necessary.  

I'm not a native speaker. If you notice any mistake, point it out, I'll gladly correct it.

Some of the following ressources come from this thread :  [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3jxvx6/where_can_i_learn_about_the_basics_of_how_the/?ref=search_posts)
